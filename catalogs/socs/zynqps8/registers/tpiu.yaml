  description: 'This register controls the generation of stop, trigger, and flush
    events.To disable formatting and put the formatter into bypass mode, bits 1 and
    0 must be clear. Setting both bits is the same as setting bit 1.All three flush
    generating conditions can be enabled together. However, if a second or third flush
    event is generated from another condition then the current flush completes before
    the next flush is serviced. Flush from flushin takes priority over flush from
    Trigger, which in turn completes before a manually activated flush. All Trigger
    indication conditions can be enabled simultaneously although this can cause the
    appearance of multiple triggers if flush using trigger is also enabled.Both ''Stop
    On'' settings can be enabled, although if flush on trigger is set up then none
    of the flushed data is stored. When the system stops, it returns atreadys and
    does not store the accepted data packets. This is to avoid stalling of any other
    devices that are connected to a Trace Replicator.If an event in the Formatter
    and Flush Control Register is required, it must be enabled before the originating
    event starts. Because requests from flushes and triggers can originate in an asynchronous
    clock domain, the exact time the component acts on the request cannot be determined
    with respect to configuring the control.Note - It is recommended that the Trace
    Port width is changed without enabling continuous mode. Enabling continuous mode
    causes data to be output from the Trace Port and modifying the port size can result
    in data not being aligned for power2 port widths.- To perform a stop on flush
    completion through a manually-generated flush request, two write operations to

    0 when read from an external debugger (paddrdbg31 = 1).
