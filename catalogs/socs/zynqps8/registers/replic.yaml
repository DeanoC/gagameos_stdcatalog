  description: 'Used to enable topology detection. See the CoreSight Architecture
    Specification for more information. This register enables the component to switch
    from a functional mode, the default behavior, to integration mode where the inputs
    and outputs of the component can be directly controlled for integration testing
    and topology solving. Note: When a device has been in integration mode, it might
    not function with the original behavior. After performing integration or topology
    detection, you must reset the system to ensure correct behavior of CoreSight and
    other connected system components that are affected by the integration or topology
    detection.'
