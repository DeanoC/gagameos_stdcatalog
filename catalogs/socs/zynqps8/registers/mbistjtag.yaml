      zero.'

    longdesc: MBISTJTAG is only connected to 1 port and thus, this field will never
      be 1.
    name: PORTCONNECTED
    shortdesc: The value of this bit is the logical AND of the PORTCONNECTED signals
      from all currently-selected ports.
    type: ro
  - bits: '1'
    longdesc: 'This bit specifies the signal to drive out on the TRST signal for the
      currently-selected port or ports. The TRST signal is active LOW, when this bit
      is set to 1 the TRST output is LOW. Although the TRST_OUT bit, bit [1] of the
      CSW Register, specifies the value to be driven on the TRST signal, writing to
      this bit only causes the signal to change. It might be necessary to clock the
      devices connected to the selected JTAG port or ports, by TCK, to enable the
      devices to recognize the change on TRST. This means that the normal process
      to perform a Test Reset of the selected JTAG ports is: 1. Write 1 to the TRST_OUT
      bit, bit [1] of the CSW Register, to specify that TRST must be asserted LOW.
      2. Drive a sequence of at least five TMS = 1 clocks from the JTAG engine. You
      can do this by issuing the command b00111111 to the JTAG engine. This sequence
      guarantees the TAP enters the Test-Logic/Reset state, even if has no TRST connection.
      3. Write 0 to the TRST_OUT bit of the CSW Register, so that the TRST signal
      is HIGH on subsequent TCK cycles. If the JTAG connection is not clocked in this
      way while TRST is asserted LOW then some or all TAPs might not reset. This bit
      does not self-reset, it must be cleared to 0 by a software write to this register.'
