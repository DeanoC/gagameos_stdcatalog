  description: BBRAM Status
  field:
  - bits: '9'
    longdesc: This bit is only valid when AES_CRC_DONE is set.
    name: AES_CRC_PASS
    shortdesc: Indicates that the AES key integrity check passed.
    type: ro
  - bits: '8'
    longdesc: Pass/Fail is indicated in the AES_CRC_PASS bit.

    name: RESERVED
    type: ro
  - bits: '4'
    longdesc: This bit will only get set after a zerize command is issued (either
      BBRAM_CTRL[ZEROIZE] or PGM_MODE).
    name: BBRAM_ZEROIZED
    shortdesc: This bit indicates when a zerization command has been successful.
    type: ro
  - bits: '3:1'
    name: RESERVED
    type: ro
  - bits: '0'
    longdesc: Entering programming mode will zeroize the current contents of the BBRAM
      and enable new contents to be loaded. The AES key integrity check can also be
      performed when the BBRAM is in programming mode.

    longdesc: WARNING, entering programming mode will erase all data in the BBRAM.
      New data can be loaded into the BBRAM once the PGM_MODE bit is set on the BBRAM_STATUS
      register.

  description: BBRAM AES Key Integrity Check
  field:
  - bits: '31:0'
    longdesc: When the check is finished the AES_CRC_DONE bit will be set in the BBRAM_STATUS
      register. If the value calculated by the BBRAM controller matches the value
      writen to this register, then the AES_CRC_PASS bit will also be set. The CRC
      check can only be performed when the BBRAM is in programming mode.
    name: AES_CRC_VALUE
    shortdesc: Writing the AES key CRC value to this register will start the AES integrity
      check.
