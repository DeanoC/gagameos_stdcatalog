  field:
  - bits: '7:4'
    longdesc: If a component only requires the standard 4KB, this bit field must read
      as 0x0, 4KB only. For 8KB set to 0x1, for 16KB set to 0x2, for 32KB set to 0x3,
      and so on.
    name: SIZE
    shortdesc: This 4-bit value indicates the total contiguous size of the memory
      window used by the component in powers of two from the standard 4KB.

  field:
  - bits: '7:4'
    longdesc: In most cases this field is zero. ARM recommendeds that the component
      designers ensure that the bit field can be changed by a metal fix if required,
      for example by driving the bit field from registers that reset to zero.
