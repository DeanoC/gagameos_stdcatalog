description: Funnel for multiple trace streams to single ATB
register:
- default: '0x00000300'
  description: The Funnel Control Register enables the slave ports and defines the
    hold time of the slave ports. Hold time refers to the number of transactions that
    are output on the funnel master port from the same slave while that slave port
    atvalidsx is HIGH. Hold time does not refer to clock cycles in this context
  field:
  - bits: '11:8'
    longdesc: If a source has nothing to transmit, then another source is selected
      irrespective of the minimum number of transactions. The ATB Funnel holds for
      the minimum hold time and one additional cycle. The maximum value that can be
      entered is 0xE and this equates to 15 cycles. 0xF is reserved.
    name: HT
    shortdesc: The formatting scheme can easily become inefficient if fast switching
      occurs, so, where possible, this must be minimized.

  description: The Priority Control Register defines the order in which inputs are
    selected. Each 3-bit field represents a priority for each particular slave interface.
    Location 0 has the priority value for the first slave port. Location 1 is the
    priority value for the second slave port, Location 2 is the third, down to location
    7, which has the priority value of the eighth slave port. Values represent the
    priority value for each port number. If you want to give highest priority to a
    particular slave port, the corresponding port must be programmed with the lowest
    value. Typically this is likely to be a port that has more important data or that
    has a small FIFO and is therefore likely to overflow. If you want to give lowest
    priority to a particular slave port, the corresponding slave port must be programmed
    with the highest value. Typically this is likely to be a device that has a large
    FIFO that is less likely to overflow or a source that has information that is
    of lower importance.

  description: This register is used to enable topology detection. For more information
    see the CoreSight Architecture Specification. This register enables the component
    to switch from a functional mode, the default behavior, to integration mode where
    the inputs and outputs of the component can be directly controlled for the purpose
    of integration testing and topology solving Note When a device has been in integration
    mode, it might not function with the original behavior. After performing integration
    or topology detection, you must reset the system to ensure correct behavior of
    CoreSight and other connected system components that are affected by the integration
    or topology detection.
