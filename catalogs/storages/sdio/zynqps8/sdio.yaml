          There are two methods to stop multiple-block read and write operation.
          (1) Auto CMD12 Enable: Multiple-block read and write commands for memory require CMD12 to stop the operation. The controller issues CMD12 automatically when the last block transfer is completed. Auto CMD12 error is indicated in the Auto CMD Error Status register. The driver shall not set this bit if the command does not require Auto CMD12.
          (2) Auto CMD23 Enable: The controller issues an Auto CMD23 before issuing a command specified in the Command Register. The following conditions are required to use the Auto CMD23:
          * Auto CMD23 Supported (Host Controller Version is 3.00 or later).
          * A memory card that supports CMD23 (SCR[33]=1).
          * If DMA is used, it shall be ADMA.
          * Only when CMD18 or CMD25 is issued. By writing the Command register, the controller issues a CMD23 first and then issues a command specified by the Command Index in Command register 32-bit block count value for CMD23 is set to SDMA System Address / Argument 2 register.
