      you must update these bits as follows: 1. Set bit[10], ETM programming, and
      bit[0], ETM power down, to 1. 2. Change the core select bits. 3. Clear bit[0],
      ETM power down, to 0. 4. Perform other programming required as normal.'

    longdesc: ETM-R5 supports only dynamic mode, corresponding to the value b000,
      but you can write other values to these bits, and a read of the register returns
      the value written. Writing another value to these bits has no effect on the
      ETM. Bit[11] of the System Configuration Register indicates if these bits are
      set to select a supported clocking mode.

    longdesc: The port size determines how many external pins are available to output
      the trace information on ATDATA[31:0]. ETM-R5 supports only the 32-bit port
      size, corresponding to a Port size[2:0] value of b0100, but you can write other
      values to these bits, and a read of the register returns the value written.
      Writing another value to these bits has no effect on the ETM. Bit[10] of the
      System Configuration Register indicates if these bits are set to select an unsupported

      bit must be cleared by the trace software tools at the beginning of a debug

      the ETM Programming bit and wait for this bit to go to 1 before reading the
