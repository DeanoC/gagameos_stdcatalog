    longdesc: This bit is set if a transmitter status write back has not completed
      when another status write back is attempted. When using the DMA interface configured
      for internal FIFO mode, this bit is also set when the transmit DMA has written
      the SOP data into the FIFO and either the AHB bus was not granted in time for
      further data, or because an AHB not OK response was returned, or because a used
      bit was read. When using the DMA interface configured for packet buffer mode,

  description: This register holds the start address of the receive buffer queue (receive
    buffers descriptor list). The receive buffer queue base address must be initialized
    before receive is enabled through bit 2 of the network control register. Once
    reception is enabled, any write to the receive buffer queue base address register
    is ignored. Reading this register returns the location of the descriptor currently
    being accessed. This value increments as buffers are used. Software should not
    use this register for determining where to remove received frames from the queue
    as it constantly changes as new frames are received. Software should instead work
    its way through the buffer descriptor queue checking the used bits. In terms of
    AMBA (AHB/AXI) operation, the receive descriptors are read from memory using a
    single 32bit AHB/AXI access. When the datapath is configured at 64bit, the receive
    descriptors should be aligned at 64-bit boundaries and each pair of 32-bit descriptors
    is written to using a single 64bit AHB/AXI access. For 32bit datapaths, the receive
    descriptors should be aligned at 32-bit boundaries and are written to using two
    individual non sequential 32-bit accesses.

  description: This register holds the start address of the transmit buffer queue
    (transmit buffers descriptor list). The transmit buffer queue base address register
    must be initialized before transmit is started through bit 9 of the network control
    register. Once transmission has started, any write to the transmit buffer queue
    base address register is illegal and therefore ignored. Note that due to clock
    boundary synchronization, it takes a maximum of four pclk cycles from the writing
    of the transmit start bit before the transmitter is active. Writing to the transmit
    buffer queue base address register during this time may produce unpredictable
    results. Reading this register returns the location of the descriptor currently
    being accessed. Since the DMA handles two frames at once, this may not necessarily
    be pointing to the current frame being transmitted. In terms of AMBA (AHB/AXI)
    AHB/AXI operation, the transmit descriptors are written to memory using a single
    32bit AHB access. When the datapath is configured at 64bit, the transmit descriptors
    should be aligned at 64-bit boundaries and each pair of 32-bit descriptors is
    read from memory using a single AHB access. For 32bit datapaths, the descriptors
    should be aligned at 32-bit boundaries and the descriptors are read from memory
    using two individual 32-bit non sequential accesses.

  description: The interrupt mask register is a read only register indicating which

  description: The PHY maintenance register is implemented as a shift register. Writing
    to the register starts a shift operation which is signalled as complete when bit-2
    is set in the network status register. It takes about 2000 pclk cycles to complete,
    when MDC is set for pclk divide by 32 in the network configuration register. An
    interrupt is generated upon completion. During this time, the MSB of the register
    is output on the MDIO pin and the LSB updated from the MDIO pin with each MDC
    cycle. This causes transmission of a PHY management frame on MDIO. See Section
    22.2.4.5 of the IEEE 802.3 standard. Reading during the shift operation will return
    the current contents of the shift register. At the end of management operation,
    the bits will have shifted back to their original locations. For a read operation,
    the data bits will be updated with data read from the PHY. It is important to
    write the correct values to the register to ensure a valid PHY management frame
    is produced. The MDIO interface can read IEEE 802.3 clause 45 PHYs as well as
    clause 22 PHYs. To read clause 45 PHYs, bit 30 should be written with a 0 rather
    than a 1. For a description of MDC generation, see Network Configuration Register.

  description: These registers reset to zero on a read and stick at all ones when
    they count to their maximum value. They should be read frequently enough to prevent
    loss of data. In order to reduce overall design area, the statistics registers
    may be optionally removed in the configuration file if they are deemed unnecsessary
    for a particular design. The receive statistics registers are only incremented
    when the receive enable bit is set in the network control register. The statistics
    registers optionally have a snapshot capability which, when exercised, will simultaneously
    store and clear the current values of all the statistics registers into a snapshot
    register set in order to allow a consistent set of statistics to be read by the
    processor. The snapshot is controlled using bit 13 of the network control register.
    The read snapshot control indicated by bit 14 of the network control register
    determines whether the processor reads the snapshot registers (logic 1) or the
    incrementing registers (logic 0). The default GEM configuration does not support
    the snapshot capability. See Parameterization section under Implementation Application
    Notes for an explanation of how to enable this function. All the statistics registers
    are read only. For test purposes they may be written by setting bit 7 (Write Enable)
    in the network control register. Setting bit 6 (increment statistics) in the network
    control register causes all the statistics registers to increment by one, again
    for test purposes. Once a statistics register has been read, it is automatically
    cleared. When reading the octets transmitted and octets received registers, bits
    31:0 should be read prior to bits 47:32 to ensure reliable operation. The statistics

  description: This register holds the start address of the transmit buffer queue
    (transmit buffers descriptor list). The transmit buffer queue base address register
    must be initialized before transmit is started through bit 9 of the network control
    register. Once transmission has started, any write to the transmit buffer queue
    base address register is illegal and therefore ignored. Note that due to clock
    boundary synchronization, it takes a maximum of four pclk cycles from the writing
    of the transmit start bit before the transmitter is active. Writing to the transmit
    buffer queue base address register during this time may produce unpredictable
    results. Reading this register returns the location of the descriptor currently
    being accessed. Since the DMA handles two frames at once, this may not necessarily
    be pointing to the current frame being transmitted. In terms of AMBA (AHB/AXI)
    AHB/AXI operation, the transmit descriptors are written to memory using a single
    32bit AHB access. When the datapath is configured at 64bit, the transmit descriptors
    should be aligned at 64-bit boundaries and each pair of 32-bit descriptors is
    read from memory using a single AHB access. For 32bit datapaths, the descriptors
    should be aligned at 32-bit boundaries and the descriptors are read from memory
    using two individual 32-bit non sequential accesses.

    use this register for determining where to remove received frames from the queue
    as it constantly changes as new frames are received. Software should instead work
    its way through the buffer descriptor queue checking the used bits. In terms of
    AMBA (AHB/AXI) operation, the receive descriptors are read from memory using a
    single 32bit AHB/AXI access. When the datapath is configured at 64bit, the receive
    descriptors should be aligned at 64-bit boundaries and each pair of 32-bit descriptors
    is written to using a single 64bit AHB/AXI access. For 32bit datapaths, the receive
    descriptors should be aligned at 32-bit boundaries and are written to using two
    individual non sequential 32-bit accesses.
