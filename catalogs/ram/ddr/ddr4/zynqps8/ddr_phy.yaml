        bits: "30"
        type: "wtc"
        shortdesc: "Impedance Calibration Bypass: Bypasses or stops, if set, impedance calibration of all ZQ control blocks that automatically triggers after reset."
        longdesc: "Impedance calibration may be triggered manually using INIT and ZCAL bits of the PIR register. This bit is self-clearing. Note: The impedance calibration is stopped immediately. However, DFI control/PHY update requests will continue to be processed. ZCTRL override does not work in this mode."

        bits: "29"
        type: "wtc"
        shortdesc: "Digital Delay Line (DDL) Calibration Pause: Pauses or halts, if set, DDL calibration."
        longdesc: "Clearing this bit will restart DDL calibrations. DDL calibration may be triggered manually using INIT and DCAL bits of the PIR register. This bit should be set to 0 during DFI low power operation."

        shortdesc: "RDIMM Initialization: Executes the RDIMM buffer chip initialization before executing DRAM initialization."
        longdesc: "The RDIMM buffer chip initialization is run after the DRAM is reset and CKE have been driven high by the DRAM initialization sequence"

        type: "rw"
        shortdesc: "Controller DRAM Initialization: Indicates if set that DRAM initialization will be performed by the controller."
        longdesc: "Otherwise if not set it indicates that DRAM initialization will be performed using the built-in initialization sequence or using software through the configuration port."
